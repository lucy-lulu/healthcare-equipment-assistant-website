## Sprint 2 Action Items

* **Planned Items:**

  * Refine personas and user stories
  * Team meeting minutes
  * Client & Supervisor meeting minutes
  * Frontend low-fidelity prototype
  * Frontend high-fidelity prototype
  * Backend database design
  * System architecture design
  * Cloud deployment of backend code (AWS)
  * Updated README including current project progress

* **Delivered Items:**

  * All planned items have been completed:
  * Personas and user stories were updated according to revised client inputs
  * All meeting minutes were documented and uploaded promptly
  * Low-fi and hi-fi prototypes were developed to reflect current system understanding
  * Backend database schema was designed
  * Backend code was successfully deployed to AWS
  * A system architecture diagram was created and reviewed by the team
  * The README now reflects the full progress made so far in both backend and frontend

## Team Feedback

* **Positive:**

  * Improved clarity in team communication and role coordination
  * Successful translation of evolving requirements into tangible design outputs
  * Effective integration between frontend and backend planning phases
  * Team adapted well to an increased scope and showed good task ownership

* **Areas for Improvement:**

  * Prototype design process could benefit from earlier internal feedback rounds
  * Backend planning would be smoother with earlier estimation of workload per feature
  * Closer alignment between visual design and technical feasibility can be further strengthened

---

## Risk and Mitigation

* **Identified Risk:**

  * **Risk 1:** Potential for client to change requirements or revoke previously promised conditions
    **Mitigation Strategy:** Maintain closer, more consistent communication with the client; be prepared to explain the necessity of key design decisions and negotiate stability in scope

  * **Risk 2:** Backend implementation workload is projected to be heavy and may exceed semester timeline
    **Mitigation Strategy:** Prioritize features based on importance; aim to deploy a basic, functional version of the system to the cloud that demonstrates the intended workflow by semester’s end
