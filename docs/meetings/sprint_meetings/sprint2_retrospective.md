## Discussion

### 1. What could have been better?
- **Meeting efficiency with supervisor:** Discussions sometimes lacked structure or ran overtime. Preparing an agenda or summary points beforehand could help make these meetings more focused and productive.
- **Client communication clarity:** Project progress could have been better conveyed through more visual methods such as diagrams, wireframes, or interactive prototypes. This would reduce misunderstandings and increase stakeholder engagement.
- **Mid-sprint check-ins:** Some blockers or misalignments were only noticed near the end. More frequent, lightweight updates (e.g., mid-week sync or check-in threads) could help catch issues earlier.

### 2. What went well?
- **Team collaboration:** Members continued to work well across subteams, helping each other resolve blockers and finish tasks on time.
- **Responsibility ownership:** Tasks were generally completed on schedule, with members showing good initiative in problem-solving and communication.
- **Technical progress:** Frontend and backend development environments were successfully set up, and initial implementation tasks proceeded smoothly.

### 3. What should we start doing?
- **Standardize code delivery:** Define shared expectations for code formatting, documentation, and PR review to streamline future collaboration.
- **Strengthen frontend-backend integration:** Encourage more real-time discussion (e.g., through short calls or shared API test environments) to align on data structure and edge cases.
- **Clarify cloud deployment workflow:** Establish clear instructions and responsible parties for deploying updates to our shared environment (e.g., dev or staging server).

### 4. For Next Sprint
- **Set deadlines for tasks:** Adding due dates to GitHub tasks will help track progress more effectively and avoid last-minute rushes.
- **Utilize burndown charts:** Consider using burndown or cumulative flow diagrams to visualize sprint progress and spot bottlenecks early.
- **Maintain standardized documentation:** Create and update key documents such as API specs, deployment guides, and integration notes in a centralized place (e.g., project wiki or Notion).
- **Schedule integration testing checkpoints:** Plan regular points for testing and merging frontend-backend progress to ensure consistent system behavior.
