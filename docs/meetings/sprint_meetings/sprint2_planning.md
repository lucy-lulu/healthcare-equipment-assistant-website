## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk 1:** Misalignment between user stories and actual user needs  
  **Mitigation Strategy:** Review stories with client and revise based on real feedback  

- **Risk 2:** Inconsistent level of detail in documentation or backlog  
  **Mitigation Strategy:** Finalise team-wide documentation conventions early in Sprint 2  

- **Risk 3:** Time constraints in prototype creation or client review delays  
  **Mitigation Strategy:** Prioritise MVP-related screens and schedule check-ins for early feedback
