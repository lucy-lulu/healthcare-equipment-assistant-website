## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk 1:** Unclear or incomplete understanding of how SAP is used at NOVIS  
  **Mitigation Strategy:** Schedule a follow-up clarification meeting with the CTO or technical lead to go over SAP workflows and modules used.

- **Risk 2:** Overlap or redundancy in research efforts across team members  
  **Mitigation Strategy:** Clearly allocate individual research topics during planning and check progress during weekly sync meetings.

- **Risk 3:** Limited knowledge of NDIS/NDIA processes may lead to incorrect assumptions  
  **Mitigation Strategy:** Use only verified sources (official websites, government docs) and compile questions for clarification with the client.
