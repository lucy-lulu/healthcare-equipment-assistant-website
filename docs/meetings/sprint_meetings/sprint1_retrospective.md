## Discussion

### 1. What could have been better?
- **Information alignment:** During requirement gathering and early research, some findings were not immediately shared across sub-teams, which led to duplicated effort and delayed consensus.
- **Unclear task granularity:** Certain research and user understanding tasks lacked structure, making it hard to estimate effort or track completion.
- **Tool familiarity:** Not all team members were initially familiar with tools like GitHub Projects or Figma, which slowed down coordination.

### 2. What went well?
- **Team participation:** Everyone actively engaged in meetings and contributed to research and ideation tasks.
- **Initial planning:** Splitting into frontend/backend and research subgroups helped distribute work efficiently.
- **Requirement engagement:** Early client meetings provided helpful insights that clarified the project scope and user context.
- **Use of project board:** The visual board helped track major items, especially research topics and document ownership.

### 3. What should we start doing?
- **Standardize research handoff:** Create a simple template for research findings to ensure consistency and ease of sharing across the team.
- **Improve cross-functional visibility:** Share updates between backend, frontend, and research teams more regularly (e.g., short async posts in chat).
- **Add acceptance criteria:** Even for research or UX tasks, define "done" more clearly (e.g., doc uploaded, reviewed, and approved).



## For Next Sprint
- **Define personas & user stories:** Finalize personas and collaboratively write user stories with clear links to research insights.
- **Select development tools:** Confirm technology stack and begin setting up project scaffolding for both frontend and backend.
- **Improve traceability:** Link tasks to outcomes (e.g., research to user stories, meetings to backlog items) for better traceability in GitHub/Project Board.
- **Increase shared documentation discipline:** Encourage centralizing decisions and research in accessible shared locations to avoid silos.
