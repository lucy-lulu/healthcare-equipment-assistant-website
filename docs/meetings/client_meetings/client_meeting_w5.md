## Discussion Summary

| **Time** | **Notes** |
| -------- | --------- |
| 11:00am   |  First, we introduced ourselves, and Howard explained to us how the existing web app works and what the problems are, using specific examples of medical products.   |
| 11:20am   |  Howard proposed the requirements for the web application we developed based on the shortcomings of the original system.      |
| 11:40am   |  Howard answered other relevant questions raised by the team.   |

- Although the existing web application can meet some needs, after the customer submits an order through the web application, the coordinator still needs to place an order in the company's internal inventory system.
- We need to improve this process by developing a new web application to save time processing inventory and facilitate the work of coordinators.
- In addition, the web application should support community transfer clinical data for OT and be able to better help customers choose medical equipment through device parameters, device usage, and medical data provided by OT.
- Howard answered questions about the project timeline and other issues raised by POs.
