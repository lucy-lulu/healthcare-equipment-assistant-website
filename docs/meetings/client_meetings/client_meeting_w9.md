## Discussion Summary
| **Time**  | **Notes** | 
|-----------|-----------|
| 10:00am    | Shared current progress: user stories, personas, selected tech stack, development roadmap. |
| 10:20am    | Reviewed prototype: design is acceptable; will include landing page with categories, account creation, product browsing, product details, enquiry list. Revise needed: Added “Place Order” button at the same level as “Enquiry” button. |
| 10:35am    | Q&A with project designer, details as below:
- End user not required (existing e-commerce covers it), but we will be open to both choice for now.  
- Business partners currently use Excel for price lookup; unclear if migrating data to SAP.  
- Confirm need product descriptions in detail page.  
- Designer can export data from PatientHandling, SAP, and WordPress(need to coordinate with Nick), then give us example data.  
- Hubspot integration is optional, may explore next semester.  
- Sales reps don’t need to see past orders.  
- Pricing varies by business partner code (e.g., silver, platinum); different price and inventory levels. When they login, define which level users are at.  
- Important core features confirmed: login, search, place order, check orders, view order history. |
