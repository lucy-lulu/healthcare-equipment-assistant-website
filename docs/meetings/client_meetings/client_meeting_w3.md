## Discussion Summary

| **Time** | **Notes** |
| -------- | --------- |
| 11:00am   |  The meeting began with introductions, and Jim explained the app's goal of assisting disabled individuals and the elderly in finding essential products like wheelchairs. This will create both social and commercial impact.   |
| 11:15am   |  The team discussed the role of the Product Owner, who will identify the client's needs, maintain updated requirements, track project progress, and serve as the liaison between the client and other team members.     |
| 11:30am   |  The project scope will be defined by Novis managers. The IT and Sales teams will evaluate their processes, and Novis will set up necessary infrastructure, including a sandbox environment of SAP and HubSpot.  |
| 11:45am | Several questions were addressed, including the major user groups (occupational therapists, companies selling related products, and tech-savvy users needing an intuitive interface). Potential features like a price display and possibly a marketplace were discussed. The app will not have a payment gateway at this stage, and there are no requirements to publish it on app stores for now. |
| 12:00pm | The team agreed on the next steps and clarified the focus on understanding Novis' background, the role of Occupational Therapists, NDIS/NDIA, and exploring existing market products. |
