## What is NDIS?
-	An Australian government-funded program that provides support and services to people with disabilities.

## What does NDIS do?
-	NDIS aims to help individuals gain access to necessary care, therapy, assistive technology, and community support, promoting independence and quality of life.
## What departments manage the NDIS and oversee it.?
-	The scheme was first introduced in 2013 following the "Make It Real" community campaign and advocacy from disability groups, and is governed by the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 ("NDIS Act"). The scheme is administered by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) as part of the Department of Social Services and overseen by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission.
## What supports does NDIS delivered?
-	To be eligible for the NDIS, applicants must be under 65 years old, be Australian citizens, permanent residents, or hold a Protected Special Category Visa, and have a permanent impairment that significantly limits their ability to perform daily activities.
-	The NDIS funds their participants the services covering categories including personal daily care, transportation, assistance of employment and therapy related issues.
-	A support will not be funded if it:
    -	is not related to the participant’s disability
    -	is the same as other supports delivered under different funding through the NDIS
    -	relates to day-to-day living costs that are not related to a participant’s support needs
    -	is likely to cause harm to the participant or pose a risk to others
    -	can be more appropriately or effectively delivered by another system, such as health or education.

## How NDIS plans are managed?
-	Each participant has funds allocated through an NDIS plan. These funds can be used for approved activities, such as therapies. There are three methods to manage an NDIS plan: participants (or their nominees) can manage the plan themselves, engage a registered plan management provider, or have it managed directly by the NDIA. Participants who choose to self-manage their plans are required to maintain detailed records of all transactions, as these may be audited in the future.
## Scheme costs?
-	The NDIS cost 29.3 billion in 2021–22, 33.9 billion in 2022–23, 38.0 billion in 2023–24 and is forecast to cost 41.4 billion in 2024–25 and 44.6 billion in 2025–26
