## 3. Project Relevance: System Requirements
For this project, NOVIS is seeking software system support. Based on initial understanding and our discussions, their requirements may include:
#### Current Challenges 
•	Inefficient Product Matching: Reliance on manual expertise to identify suitable devices, requiring multiple client interactions. 
•	Complex Subsidy Processes: NDIS applications involve cross-agency coordination, prone to human error. 
•	Fragmented Order Management: Separate workflows for sales and rentals, lacking integrated data.
#### Priority System Modules 
1. Product Management  
    a. Requirements:  
        i. Multi-brand SKU categorization (by function/usage scenario).  
        ii. Real-time inventory visibility (SAP integration).  
        iii. Dynamic pricing rules (rental vs. sale).  
    b. Development Focus:  
        Unified product database compatible with brand-specific parameters  
        (e.g., weight capacity, dimensions).  

2. Transaction Process Tracking  
    a. Requirements:  
        i. Unified order interface (sales, rentals, custom services).  
        ii. Automated NDIS reimbursement document generation.  
    b. Development Focus:  
        Status tracking labels  
        (e.g., "Pending Approval," "In Transit," "Renewal Reminder").  

3. Customer Management  
    a. Requirements:  
        i. Centralized client profiles (NDIS ID, institution type).  
        ii. Equipment usage history and feedback records.  
    b. Development Focus:  
        Role-based access controls  
        (e.g., institutional clients managing sub-accounts).

#### Critical Integration Needs 
-	Legacy System Compatibility: SAP (inventory), NDIS subsidy platform (eligibility checks), payment gateways (installments/insurance direct billing). 
-	Data Compliance: Device IDs aligned with manufacturer coding standards; client data encryption per Australian privacy laws (e.g., secure NDIS ID storage).
