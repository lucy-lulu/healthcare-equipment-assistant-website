## Overview:
Founded in 1972, SAP has grown from a small startup to a global enterprise headquartered in Walldorf, Germany, with over 105,000 employees. SAP revolutionized Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) with SAP R/2 and R/3, setting the industry standard. Its latest solution, SAP S/4HANA, leverages in-memory computing, AI, and machine learning to enhance business processes.

SAP’s integrated applications connect all business functions into a unified digital platform, replacing outdated legacy systems. Today, SAP serves over 230 million cloud users, offering 100+ business solutions and the largest cloud portfolio in the industry. Led by CEO Christian Klein, SAP helps businesses operate profitably, adapt continuously, and grow sustainably.

Traditional decentralized data management creates inefficiencies and data duplication. SAP centralizes data, providing real-time insights across departments, improving efficiency, productivity, and customer experience. This streamlined approach accelerates workflows, reduces costs, and ultimately boosts profitability.
