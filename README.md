# NOV-healthcare-equipment-assistant -- final project swen90017/18

## Project Background
Clients of the NDIS (and perhaps the NDIA) can have trouble choosing the equipment they need, which best matches their particular disability and which the service is willing to pay for or sufficiently subsidise.
NOVIS manage these complications with a manual process which works well but is time-consuming for all concerned, and can occasionally misfire. So NOVIS are commissioning a software solution that involves multiple creative interfaces, tuned for accessibility, joined with a smart backend that integrates with multiple sources of relevant information. 
The project will have a focus on the technologies required to integrate with SAP. 

## Project Board
The project board in NOV team serves as a dynamic tool for managing and tracking the progress of tasks, recording sprint backlogs for each sprint(planned backlogs as well), and also ensuring the project remains on schedule and that all team members are aligned with the project's goals. By visualizing the workflow, from task assignment to completion, it allows the team to identify bottlenecks, prioritize tasks, and allocate resources effectively. It acts as a real-time dashboard that provides a clear overview of what tasks are in progress, which ones are pending, and what has been completed, fostering accountability and transparency within the team. By providing a centralized platform for project management, the project board not only streamlines the execution process but also ensures that the project stays on track towards its objectives.

## Wiki Page

The wiki page for the this project is a critical resource that consolidates all project documentation, facilitating seamless collaboration, knowledge sharing, and process alignment among team members. By serving as a central hub for information, it ensures that everyone involved in the project has access to the latest details, decisions, and technical guidelines. This helps to maintain consistency across the project's development stages and supports effective onboarding for new team members. Our team tend to use "10-seconds test" to verify the use and comprehensive of our wiki page design.
